# Mess-Management-System
A novice mess management system coded in c++.

I made this for a lab project at the end of a CS103 Intro to Programming.

It is a very basic system that adheres to the question statement attached (CS103L_AI_Project.pdf).

The program would create a file data.csv and write the data into that file.
